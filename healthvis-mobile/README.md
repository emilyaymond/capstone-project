# HealthVis Mobile

Accessible health data visualization app built with Expo and React Native. Integrates directly with Apple HealthKit to provide comprehensive health and fitness data visualization.

## Features

- 🏥 **Direct HealthKit Integration**: Access comprehensive health data including vitals, activity, body measurements, nutrition, sleep, and mindfulness
- 🎯 **4 Accessibility Modes**: Visual, Audio, Hybrid, Simplified
- 🔊 **Audio Feedback**: Button clicks, mode changes, data sonification
- 📳 **Haptic Feedback**: Touch-based feedback for data exploration
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech**: Spoken summaries of health data
- 👆 **Touch-to-Explore**: Interactive charts with audio/haptic feedback
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Line and bar charts with accessibility features
- ⚙️ **Customizable Settings**: Font size, contrast, audio/haptic toggles
- 💾 **Offline Support**: Cached data for offline viewing

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# iOS Setup (Required for HealthKit)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Start the app
npm start

# Press 'i' for iOS simulator (limited HealthKit support)
# Run on physical iOS device for full HealthKit access
```

## HealthKit Setup

### Prerequisites

- Physical iOS device (HealthKit is not fully supported in simulator)
- iOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 12.0 or later

### Permissions

On first launch, the app will request permissions to access the following HealthKit data:

**Vitals:**
- Heart Rate
- Blood Pressure
- Respiratory Rate
- Body Temperature
- Oxygen Saturation
- Blood Glucose

**Activity:**
- Steps
- Distance
- Flights Climbed
- Active Energy
- Exercise Minutes

**Body Measurements:**
- Weight
- Height
- BMI
- Body Fat Percentage

**Nutrition:**
- Dietary Energy (Calories)
- Water Intake
- Protein, Carbohydrates, Fats

**Sleep & Mindfulness:**
- Sleep Analysis
- Mindfulness Minutes

### Enabling Permissions

If you deny permissions initially, you can enable them later:

1. Open iOS Settings
2. Navigate to Privacy & Security → Health
3. Select HealthVis
4. Enable the data types you want to share

## Testing

### Unit & Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- healthkit-service.test.ts
```

### Integration Testing
